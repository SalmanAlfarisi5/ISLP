Statistical Learning -> set of tools for understanding data
Supervised Statistical Learning -> Building statistical model for predicting output based on input
Unsupervised Statistical Learning -> Find relationships and structures from data (only consisted of inputs with no supervising output)
Regression -> Predicting continuous or quantitative output value
Classification -> Predict which discrete class the dataset is belong to
Clustering -> Find grouping among dataset with no supervising value

Premises:
- Many statistical learning methods are relevant and useful in wide range of academic and non-academic discipline.
- Statistical learning should not be viewed as a series of black boxes. No single approach will perform well in all possible applications
- Do the coding

Notations
- $n$ is number of distinct data points
- $p$ is number of variables
- $x$ is features or independent variables
- $y$ is target or dependent variable
